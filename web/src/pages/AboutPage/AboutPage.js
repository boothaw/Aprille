          Aprille Zammit can often be found in her studio, covered in ink
          working on her next creative project. A graphic designer and DIY
          screen printer who chose to follow her passion and devote much more
          time to this craft. Having studied at VCU in Richmond Virginia for 4
          years, Aprille has always been in a rich creative environment and her
          dream is to help create a more vibrant and active creative community
          in Malta. She finds most of her inspiration from nature and the
          oceans, being a lover of any and all water-related sports. She can
          also rarely be seen without a film camera hanging from her neck, as
          film photography is just one of her other passions
